# conexion 200 sensor extraction

Tools to integrate the conexion box into a smart home and make use of the sensors and data it extracts from varios heating systems.

As I currently have a new Regula Grandis 650 HK and the conexio 200 module, that only has a webpage with no API or any other real means to integrate it into out smart home systems, I decided to write a small tool, that can extract the sensor data and publish it via MQTT.
